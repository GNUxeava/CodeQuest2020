Okay I am officially dumb now. My uni organised a programming contest where 51 students including me qualified for second round.

In the first problem we had to determine whether the entered string is a decimal. I did that in C.

In the second problem, we had to take in an array of integers and an integer to divide against the elements of the array. Determine the sum of elements successively and if it is divisible by the entered integer, increment the count. I did this one in C++.

Both questions failed all of the test cases.
We were given 45 minutes in total.

Feels good to be dumb.
